1,Curtis Prairie,,43.0380370480251,-89.43455865,"When the UW Arboretum was initially established, Aldo Leopold proposed using the arboretum to restore Wisconsin landscapes, specifically those that were common pre European settlement. Although it is unclear where ecological restoration was created, Aldo Leopold and the UW Arboretum are part of the foundation of ecological restoration. At the beginning of the arboretum, Curtis prairie was no more than an abandoned agricultural field. Leopold and the UW Arboretum restored this field to reflect tallgrass or mesic prairies of Wisconsin. John Curtis conducted research surrounding restoration and plant community ecology, and because of this, the prairie is named in this honor. Today, Curtis prairie is the world’s oldest restored prairie and reflects years of experimental planting techniques, prescribed burning, education, and research.

2,Leopold Pines,,43.037023728352,-89.43512492,"Between 1933 and 1937, Civilian Conservation Corps crews planted red pine, eastern white pine, and other Northern Wisconsin tree species in this area. This restoration most closely resembles a northern dry-mesic forest community, although there are features that would not be found in northern Wisconsin, such as the vines commonly found throughout the planting. Northern dry-mesic forests are dominated by red and white pine. Previous experiments have taken place in this restoration to establish northern shrubs and forbs without much success. Understory shrubs such as hazelnut and blueberry are found in this community, as well as common forbs such as wild sarsaparilla, Canada mayflower, and cow-wheat.",Head south on the walking trail to marker C6.,stop2.jpg
3,Red and White Pines,,43.0370242918588,-89.43450893,"In this location you can directly compare two of the three Wisconsin native pines, eastern white pine and red pine. The third species, jack pine, can be found on the south side of the west beltline highway in the Enjuve Pines planting or in the horticulture garden. When looking at this group of trees, eastern white pine can be distinguished by its dark gray, fissured, and scaly bark. Eastern white pine’s crowns also tend to be more full, white red pine’s crowns are more clumped and sparse. Red pine has red and flaky bark. If you are able to get up close to the trees, red pine’s needles are clumped in groups of 2 while white pine is clumped in groups of 5. Red pines tend to be more shade intolerant and drought tolerant than white pine, making them more common in southern Wisconsin due to the increased aridity. ",Follow the trail west and stop at the bend.,stop3.jpg
4,Oak Savanna,,43.0407866974989,-89.42739659,"At this point, you are able to view a restored oak savanna. Oak savannas are characterized by an oak canopy covering a layer of prairie plants. In order to maintain an oak savanna, there needs to be frequent burns in order to maintain the canopy closure and plant composition. In a well restored or healthy oak savanna, shrubs are non-existent due to fire. Oaks and prairie plants exhibit fire tolerance mechanisms, such as deep root systems in grasses, thick bark that prevents fire damage, or oak leaf litter that encourages fire spread. Although oak savannas were commonly found across Wisconsin, covering 5.5 million acres in Wisconsin, their range is ten thousandths that today due to decreased burning and human influence. Prescribed burning is increasing in Wisconsin, and will hopefully lead to an increase of these communities as well as other fire dependent communities.","Travel west towards marker B8, then travel north towards marker B5 where you will head northeast to marker A7.",stop4.jpg
5,Gallistel Woods,,43.0423421976188,-89.42570263,"While this forest may have a few oaks still lingering in the overstory, this forest primarily represents Wisconsin’s southern mesic forest community. This community is dominated by a dense overstory of sugar maples, which will be highlighted later in the tour. Within this restoration, you are also able to see plantings of basswood and beech trees. There are typically not many shrubs in the understory of this community. In addition, spring visitors will be able to see many spring ephemerals such as dutchman’s breeches, bloodroot, and trillium. Spring ephemerals are able to thrive in this environment due to early sprouting before the leaf out of the dense maple overstory. Earthworms can be a threat to this community by breaking down the leaf litter and changing the nutrient cycle of the system.","Continue traveling northwest toward marker F1, take a left to reach marker F5, then take a right to marker F4, where you will take a final left to reach marker F6.",stop5.jpg
6,Sugar Maples,,43.0470954321335,-89.42387762,"Sugar maples are a keystone Wisconsin species and are incredibly frequent all across Wisconsin. This area of the arboretum has a high density of sugar maples, which can be seen in the over and understory of this forest. Sugar maples are distinguished by 3-5 lobed leaves, dark and deeply furrowed bark, and pointed buds. If you are visiting in fall, the leaves of sugar maples will be bright yellows, oranges, and reds. Sugar maples dominate forests by creating dense canopies and rapidly decomposing leaf litter that encourage growth of their shade tolerant seedlings. In Wisconsin, sugar maple trees are also tapped in the spring time for sap to create maple syrup. ","Head on the eastern side of the horticultural garden and then follow arboretum drive to the Wingra Woods parking lot trailhead, where you will head east to marker K2.",stop6.jpg
7,Wingra Woods,,43.0477995590784,-89.42430331,"In this section of Wingra Woods, you can view a forest that reflects northern mesic forests in Wisconsin. This plot was restored by foresters previously to demonstrate a very common forest community of northern Wisconsin. Take note of the dominant tree species in this location: eastern hemlock, sugar maples, and yellow birch. Previously in the hike you may have noted beech which is also found in mesic forests closer to Lake Michigan. Mesic forests contain trees that are adapted to wetter conditions. Because of clear cutting forestry, most mesic forest stands do not reflect old growth structures. Current forests lack diversity in tree species, which is seen through an overabundance of sugar maples. In Northern Wisconsin, mesic forests may also contain eastern white pine, basswood, and white ash, as well as other sub canopy trees and understory forbs. Canopies will be dense and have wet, fertile soils. Although these species are not reflected in this restoration, this plot is still able to give you a sense of Wisconsin’s northern mesic forests through the most dominant species. ",Follow the trail north to marker K4.,stop7.jpg
8,Marsh and Big Spring,,43.0476634770477,-89.42777573,"At this site, there is a spring feeding into Lake Wingra. This lake has many springs that feed into it, although many have been lost due to human development and land use change. As you look into the spring, you will see many plants characteristic of wetland communities. To the left one can spot the eastern larch, a deciduous conifer, which means that its needles fall following the growing season unlike most other conifers (such as the pines that were viewed earlier in the tour). You can also see aquatic plants, mosses, and liverworts near or in the shallow waters of the spring. Looking north, there are many various types of shrubs including alder, viburnum, dogwood, and witch hazel. In the late winter, skunk cabbage flowers pop up in this location indicating one of the earlier signs of spring in the area. As you continue walking back to the Curtis prairie, take note of Lake Wingra and the marsh on your right and sugar maple dominated forest on your left. Once you get closer to the Curtis prairie, you may see the horticulture garden which has a wide variety of native and non-native tree and shrub species. ",Head west to the big spring lookout.,stop8.jpg
9,End,,43.0382554201063,-89.43417132,"If you’d like, take a moment to reflect on the history behind the restorations, various communities, and surrounding ecology. The arboretum is a loved plot of land that reflects a lot of history and passion for Wisconsin landscapes. Think about how these landscapes reflect Wisconsin and consider venturing out to explore more of what Wisconsin has to offer on your next adventure!","Follow the walking trails southwest to arboretum drive, where you can follow the road back to Curtis Prairie.",end.jpg
